## Autonomous Flight Engineering Training: Project 1

# Backyard Flyer
This project was aimed towards getting a drone to fly a pre-determined flight path autonomously. 
It goes further to introduce the event driven programming paradigm in python, that will be essential in the development of autonomous aerial systems.

### To successfully complete this project, I:
  - Wrote a python class to interface with Udacity's Udacidrone API. This is the API to the high fidelity aerial systems simulator that is used to test the drone in this project.
  - Designed and wrote event driven python methods that would allow the drone to takeoff, fly towards a particular set of checkpoints and land safely.
  - Tested the program through the Udacity aerial simulator.
  - Had lots of fun!
  
### To run this project:
  - Download Udacity's aerial simulator. Its Github link is below.
  ```
  https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Simulator-Releases/releases
  ```
  - Have a look at the Udacidrone API so as to maintain sanity while going through the project. Download dependent modules.
  ```
  https://udacity.github.io/udacidrone/docs/welcome.html
  ```
  - Clone this repository.
  - Navigate to the *FCND-Backyard-Flyer* folder.
  - While the simulator's Backyard Flyer instance is running, run:
  ```
  python backyard_flyer.py
  ```
  - Enjoy the simple backyard flyer.
